# 📚 Student Failure Predictor  

## 🚀 Overview  
This project helps teachers predict which students are **at risk of failing** based on:  
- **📖 Study Time (hours/week)** – How many hours a student studies per week.  
- **🏫 Attendance (days/week)** – How often they attend class.  

If a student **doesn’t study enough** and **skips classes**, they’re more likely to fail.  
This app lets teachers **input study time & attendance** and see **predictions** instantly.  

## 🎯 Features  
✅ **Predict if a student will pass or fail**  
✅ **See the probability of passing/failing**  
✅ **Interactive scatter plot visualization**  
✅ **Simple, user-friendly interface**  

## 🤖 Technologies Used  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Scikit-Learn** – Machine Learning  
- **Streamlit** – Web App Interface  
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** – Data Visualization
